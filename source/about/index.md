I originally started this blog in 2015 to track my journey from an optical engineer working in forensics to a database developer.  I've learned a lot about database design since that time and recently became a fullstack developer.  

Some of my hobbies outside of programming include training my dog (obedience, agility, swimming, etc), learning American Sign Language, speedsolving rubiks cubes, practicing card magic, and playing boardgames.
